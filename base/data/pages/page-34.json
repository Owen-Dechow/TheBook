{"instructions": "Mash the garlic and saut\u00e9 in the butter. Rub the meat with salt and flour and brown it well on all sides in\nthe butter. Lay the meat on a bed of thin-sliced onion in a large Dutch oven or any pot with a tight-fitting lid.\nAdd the butter, spices, and seasonings, and pour the rum or wine over the meat. *(A good pot roast will supply\nmost of its own juices, but as it cooks pour the 1/2 cup of water over it to make an ample supply of gravy)*.\nCover tightly and simmer for 3 or 4 hours until the roast is tender. If you want carrots with the pot roast, add\nthem to the pot for the last half-hour of cooking. Remove roast and carrots to a warm platter. Make gravy\nwith the possible addition of 1 jar of brown gravy and 1 envelope of brown gravy mix and the necessary\nflour thickening.", "ingredients": ["3-4 lb pot roast", "2 cloves garlic", "4 tbsp butter", "Salt", "Flour", "1 large onion sliced", "12 whole peppercorns", "12 whole allspice", "1 bay leaf, crumbled", "1 tbsp grated horseradish", "1/2 cup rum or dry red wine", "1/2 cup water", "Small whole carrots, or large carrots quartered", "1 envelope McCormick brown gravy mix and/or 1 jar brown gravy"], "name": "Indian Pot Roast", "creator": "", "tags": ["beef"]}

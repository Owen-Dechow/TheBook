{"instructions": "FOR THE HOLES & TOPPING:\n3 1/4 tbsp butter, frozen and cut in 50 pieces\n1/2 cup brown sugar, packed\n1 tsp cinnamon\n\nPrepare mashed potatoes. Dissolve yeast in warm water, add pinch of sugar and let stand until bubbles\nform. In a large bowl cream margarine, shortening, granulated sugar and salt. Add scalded milk, mashed\npotatoes and whisk until well blended. With a wooden spoon stir in a cup of flour. Then mix in the beaten\negg and yeast mixture. Gradually mix in flour until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the\nbowl. At this point it is probably easier to mix in just enough flour by hand until this very soft dough is\nsmooth and can be held in your hand and transferred to a greased bowl for rising. Turn the dough until it is\ngreased all over. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in an 85 F oven until it has doubled in size *(about 1 1/4\nhours)*.\nPunch down and knead on a lightly floured board for 5 minutes. Then divide in two and spread evenly in\ntwo buttered 8x8 inch pans. Again, cover and let rise until it doubles *(about 1 1/4 hours)*. Make 25 holes\nwith your finger in each pan and press small pieces of butter into the holes in the dough. Combine brown\nsugar and cinnamon and fill the holes using about 3/4 of the brown sugar mixture and sprinkle the remaining\nsugar over the dough. Bake in a preheated 365 F oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until it is golden brown and\ncrusty on top.", "ingredients": ["1/2 cup hot fluffy mashed potatoes", "6 tbsp granulated sugar", "1 pkg dry yeast", "1/4 cup warm water (105-115 F)", "1/2 cup scalded milk", "4 tbsp butter", "2 tbsp shortening", "1 tsp salt", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "3 1/4 to 3 3/4 cups sifted flour"], "name": "Moravian Sugar Cake", "creator": "Jim Decker", "tags": ["salad"]}

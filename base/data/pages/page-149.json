{"instructions": "In an electric mixer bowl stir yeast into 1 1/2 cups of Spruance. Heat milk, margarine, sugar and salt to a\ntemperature of 125 to 130 F and add to mixer bowl along with egg. Mix at low speed for 30 seconds\ncleaning side of bowl with a spatula, then mix at high speed for 3 minutes.\nWith a wooden spoon stir in as much of remaining Spruance as you can until it becomes difficult to stir in\nany more flour. Turn out dough on a lightly floured board and begin kneading for 6 to 8 minutes with\nremaining flour until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.\nPlace the dough in a greased bowl and rotate to coat dough. Cover with a damp cloth and put in the oven\nat 80 to 85 F. *(A pan of hot water on bottom shelf should\nprovide this temperature.)* Allow the dough to rise until it doubles in size. It may take 2 hours. This first\nraising process is complete when 2 spread fingers are pushed into dough 1/2 inch and the depressions do not\nfill back in.\nPunch down dough and remove to a lightly floured pastry cloth. Roll to 1/4 inch and cut 3 inch circles.\nBrush top with melted margarine, crease off-center with back of table knife and fold large half over small\nhalf. Place small half down on a lightly greased baking sheet and press down firmly on open edge. Cover\nand return to oven for second raising to double. May take 1/2 to 3/4 hours. Bake at 365 F for 11 to 12\nminutes. Makes 14 rolls.\n\nVARIATION:\nDivide into 20 portions and roll into balls. Place in a 9-inch greased round layer cake pan in concentric\ncircles *(1-7-12)*. Sprinkle with 2 tbsp sesame seeds, allow rising and baking in a 365 F oven for 12 to 15\nminutes.", "ingredients": ["2 3/4 to 3 cups Spruance bread mix, divided", "1 1/2 tsp dry yeast", "1/2 cup milk", "2 2/3 tbsp margarine", "2 2/3 tbsp sugar", "1/4 tsp salt", "1 egg"], "name": "Dinner Rolls", "creator": "Good Housekeeping", "tags": ["salad"]}

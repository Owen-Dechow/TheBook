{"instructions": "Mix the bread crumbs, nutmeg, cayenne, salt and pepper in a small bowl and set aside. Roll each of the\nhard-boiled eggs in flour and shake off excess. Divide sausage into 6 pieces and flatten each into a circle\nlarge enough to enclose an egg. Wrap each egg in sausage making sure that they're evenly covered.\nBeat the raw egg lightly in a small bowl. Dip a sausage-covered egg in the beaten egg, roll in the crumb\nmixture coating evenly and set aside. Dip and coat the remaining eggs. Refrigerate the coated eggs for half\nan hour.\nTo cook the eggs, heat the oil to 350 F in a skillet over low heat. When the oil is hot add 3 of the eggs and\ncook until browned, turning once or twice. Do not over-heat the oil or the sausage will crack. It should take 6\nor 7 minutes. Cook remaining 3 eggs.", "ingredients": ["6 large eggs, hard-boiled, cooled and shelled", "Flour", "1 lb bulk pork sausage (hot Italian for variety)", "1/4 cup dried bread crumbs", "1/2 tsp grated nutmeg", "Pinch cayenne pepper", "Salt and pepper to taste", "1 large egg, beaten", "Vegetable oil"], "name": "Scotch Eggs", "creator": "", "tags": ["brunch&breakfast"]}
